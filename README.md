Mopidy (Audio Server) on the Raspberry Pi 3

- Mopidy is an extensible music server that plays music from local disk, Spotify, SoundCloud, Google Play Music, and more. You edit the playlist from any phone, tablet, or computer using a range of MPD and web clients. Head off to https://www.mopidy.com to learn more about the Mopidy music server.
- Let's step through the commands to download and install the base Mopidy player on your RaspberryPi
  - Download and install git on Raspbian using "sudo apt-get install git". This will install the git client on your RaspberryPi. You will need the git client to clone a lot of the repositories included in this tutorial.
  - Clone the github repository for Mopidy from https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy using "git clone https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy"
  - Change into downloaded Mopidy directory to build and install using the following commands, "sudo python setup.py install". This should build and install mopidy.
  - Clone the github repository for Mopidy-AlsaMixer from https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-alsamixer using "git clone https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-alsamixer"
  - Change into the downloaded mopidy-alsamixer directory to build and install using the following commands, "sudo python setup.py install". This should build and install mopidy-alsamixer.
- Now that we have installed Mopidy we need to review some of the other non-documented dependencies we will need to install. If we had not installed Mopidy from source (github) and rather installed Mopidy using the Raspbian packages (sudo apt-get install mopidy) the system would have auto resolved the dependencies.
- However, we've chosen not to install the stock packages since they are really outdated. We prefer the latest stable codebase from Github.
- Lets proceed now and manually install the following packages. These are part of the pre-requisites which i found missing and spent sometime/effort understanding what was required. The commands are - 
  - sudo apt-get install python-gst-1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-tools
  - sudo apt-get install gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0
- You will now need to open up your Mopidy configuration file at /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf and edit it to suit your requirements. For details on each of the configuration options please visit - https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/config/
- Please including configuration for the Mopidy AlsaMixer module into /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf file. You can refer to a sample config at https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-alsamixer
- Now that we've got this far we'll need to add the local repository to the configuration. See your [local] configuration section and add the location path to your music store. This one needs to be configured with a simple local unix path. 
- Start up Mopidy using "sudo /path/to/mopidy --config /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf" and you should review the errors on the screen. Work through the errors. 
- Best case outcome would be that the only error is that the local plugin configuration has not found any files. Run the following command to initiate creation of a local cache, "sudo /path/to/mopidy --config /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf local scan". This should run for a while depending on how much content you've got in your local music repository. I use my usb drive mounted on /mnt/usb0 and it took a while for Mopidy to scan through the content. 
- Once you've setup mopidy you should confirm if you are able to connect to the User Interface. Start mopidy with the command, "sudo /path/to/mopidy --config /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf". Then connect to the user interface via a web browser  http://RaspberryPI_IP_Address_Here:6680/
- If you have the musicbox client installed you will see a link for it at the above page. Else you'll need to clone the git repository for Mopidy Musicbox Web client using "git clone https://github.com/pimusicbox/mopidy-musicbox-webclient"
  - Change into the downloaded mopidy-musicbox directory to build and install using the following commands, "sudo python setup.py install". This will build and install the mopidy-musicbox package onto the RaspberryPi.
  - Once you've installed mopidy music box you should confirm if you are able to connect to the User Interface. 
  - Start mopidy with the command, "sudo /path/to/mopidy --config /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf".
  - Then connect to the user interface via a web browser  http://RaspberryPI_IP_Address_Here:6680/musicbox_webclient/index.html

- Obviously you might consider automating the startup of Mopidy. Like everything on unix/linux there's tons of ways of doing this. You could consider using daemon (daemontools) or simply /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Key in the startup command into rc.local and reboot the machine to find mopidy running in the background.
- Enjoy listening to your music!!!

Alexa on the Raspberry Pi 3
- Alexa as you know is Amazon's Voice service and now configurable on most maker platforms including the Raspberry Pi 3. This project is a fork of Sam Machin's code base including use of a tactile button and a single RGB LED.
- Components required include
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 (I have used a 3, Model B. You can use whatever you have at your disposal.)
  - 1 x RGB LED 
    - https://tkkrlab.nl/wiki/Arduino_KY-016_3-color_LED_module
    - https://littlebirdelectronics.com.au/products/arduino-compatible-rgb-led-module
    - http://www.dx.com/p/diy-arduino-3-color-rgb-smd-led-module-black-135046
  - 1 x Breadboard
  - 1 x Extension cable (Suggested) to extend the GPIO ports of the Raspberry Pi and bring them closed to the breadboard
  - 10 x Jumper cables - Female (connect to Rasberry Pi GPIO) to Male (Connect to the Breadboard)
  - 1 x Tactile Push button
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi Cobbler board (Recommended, to breakout the GPIO's) and make working easier
- Code base can be obtained from the following github repository - https://github.com/tangowhisky37/AlexaPi
